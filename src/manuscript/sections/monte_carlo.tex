\section{Monte-Carlo Study}
\label{section:monte_carlo}

In this last section I test the aforementioned extension. The study compares algorithm
\ref{algorithm:1} and \ref{algorithm:2} in the case of $d=4$. For this I develop a data
generating process (DGP) which fulfills the more general assumption \ref{assumption:1}
with $\kappa < d$.
