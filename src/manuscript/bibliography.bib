    abstract = {Summary Predicting scalar outcomes by using functional predictors is a
                classical problem in functional data analysis. In many applications,
                however, only specific locations or time points of the functional
                predictors have an influence on the outcome. Such ‘points of impact’ are
                typically unknown and must be estimated in addition to estimating the
                usual model components. We show that our points-of-impact estimator
                enjoys a superconsistent rate of convergence and does not require
                knowledge or pre-estimates of the unknown model components. This
                remarkable result facilitates the subsequent estimation of the remaining
                model components as shown in the theoretical part, where we consider the
                case of non-parametric models and the practically relevant case of
                generalized linear models. The finite sample properties of our
                estimators are assessed by means of a simulation study. Our methodology
                is motivated by data from a psychological experiment in which the
                participants were asked to rate their emotional state continuously while
                watching an affective video eliciting a varying intensity of emotional
                reactions.},
